# .html_filter
Simple yet effective

This is a simple python project ive been working on while on my quest to learn about programming and applying code to make something useful. 

**The output file will show up in whatever directory the html_filter.py file is stored in***

Install the requirements.txt or just copy "pip install tabulate"

If there is anyway you think i can improve it or if you have any sugestions on python projects to help me learn to program fell free to reach out to me on discord @blanko_zr 

If you like leave a star thank you.
